# Tennis pose detection

An app made in Flutter to automatically take pictures of your best moments playing tennis.

The idea is:
- Take a picture
- Run the [Posetnet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models) model
- Check if you are performing a forehand, backhand or serving movement
- If so, save the picture
- repeat


### Notes
- I only tested it on Android.
